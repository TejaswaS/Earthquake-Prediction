Description

This project is a machine learning system that analyzes historical earthquake data to visualize global seismic activity and predict earthquake magnitude and depth using a neural network. It includes data preprocessing, timestamp conversion, geospatial mapping, and model tuning to improve prediction performance. The project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to real-world disaster prediction problems.
